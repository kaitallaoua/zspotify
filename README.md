# ZYSpotify

[![GPLv3](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jsavargas/zspotify)](https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0)

This is a moderately modifed fork of ZSpotify with the goal of more robust large downloads (sqlite db instead of json archive file), eventually with the purpose to be run periodically/as a service to fetch new songs and more. A fork was decided as many, many changes were desired to be implemented more quickly than PR's.

Currently only a subset of switches are supported, but eventually should be feature matched to zspotify. Only the shown switches in the usage are what have been tested, others may work (if NotImplementedError is removed).

ZYSpotify is a Spotify downloader that enables users to find and download (a lot of) songs.

## Roadmap

- [x] Use sqlite3 db instead of json archive
- [x] Put credentials in db
- [ ] Ensure pip install works
- [ ] Get all other switches working
- [ ] Use logging libary instead of printing
- [ ] Check for new artist songs/albums feature
- [ ] Ensure docker support works
- [ ] Conform project for strict type checking
- [ ] Use code coverage/test suites
